Team composition requirements:
* The game only supports 6 or 8 players, divided into two equal teams.
* For 6 players: Two teams of three players each.
* For 8 players: Two teams of four players each.
* All odd-numbered players (1,3,5,7) form one team, and all even-numbered players (2,4,6,8) form the other team.
* Players should alternate team membership when seated (odd-even-odd-even).

Cards requirements:
* A standard 52-card deck with 8s removed from all suits is used (48 cards total).
* Card distribution:
  * For 6 players: Each player receives 8 cards
  * For 8 players: Each player receives 6 cards

Game objective requirements:
* The game ends when all the sets have been declared or removed from play.
* The team with the most sets wins.
* Each collected set counts as 1 point.
* If the teams have the same number of sets, the game is a draw.

Gameplay rules requirements:
* A randomly selected player starts the game.
* Play proceeds clockwise.
* On their turn, a player must choose exactly one of the following actions:
  * Declare a set
  * Request a specific card from a specific opponent
* There is no passing or skipping turns.
* Card requests:
  * A player may only request cards from a set for which they have at least one card (a root card).
  * Players can only request a specific card from a specific opponent.
  * Players cannot request cards they already possess.
  * Players cannot request cards from teammates.
  * If the opponent has the requested card, they transfer it to the requester, who gets another turn.
  * If the opponent does not have the requested card, the turn passes to that opponent. No cards are exchanged.
* Set declarations:
  * To declare a set, the player must first specify which set they are declaring.
  * The player must have at least one card from the set they are declaring.
  * The player must correctly identify which players on their team have each card in the set.
  * If all cards are correctly identified, the set is awarded to the declaring team, all cards in the set are removed from play, and the declaring player takes another turn.
  * If any card is incorrectly identified:
    * Scenario 1: If all the cards in the set were within the player's team but incorrectly identified, the set is removed from play with no points awarded to either team.
    * Scenario 2: If any card in the set is held by the opposing team, the set is awarded to the opposing team and removed from play.
    * The declaring player's turn ends, and play passes to the next player in sequence.
* Team communication:
  * Players may not directly communicate about their specific cards with teammates.
  * Strategic discussion about which opponent to ask is permitted, but without revealing card details.
* The game ends when all the sets have been declared or removed from play.
* There are no cancellations of a decision once made (to request a card or declare a set).
